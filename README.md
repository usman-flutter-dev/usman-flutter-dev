# Assalam-O-Alaikum! I'm Muhammad Usman  

### Flutter Developer | Firebase & API-Driven Mobile Apps | Building Scalable Apps for Startups & Businesses
I build **Flutter mobile applications** with a strong focus on **clean UI**, **structured architecture**, and **Firebase-powered features**.  
My work centers around turning real-world ideas into functional, maintainable apps using modern Flutter practices.

## 🔍 What I Can Do

- Build **cross-platform mobile apps** using Flutter & Dart  
- Design clean, responsive UI with reusable widgets  
- Implement **MVVM architecture** for scalable codebases  
- Use **GetX** for state management, navigation, and dependency injection  
- Integrate **Firebase** (Auth, Firestore, Realtime features)  
- Consume and manage **REST APIs**  
- Structure apps with readability, maintainability, and future growth in mind

## 📱 Projects

I have built multiple Flutter applications covering common real-world use cases, including:

- 🧑‍💼 **Job Posting App**  
  Job listings, detail views, and structured data handling  

- 🍽️ **Home-Cook Made App**  
  Food listings, user interaction, and dynamic UI components  

- 💬 **Real-Time Chat App**  
  Firebase-powered messaging with real-time updates  

- 📅 **Booking App**  
  Appointment flow, user inputs, and data persistence  

- ➕ And other experimental apps focused on learning and refinement  

Each project helped me strengthen my understanding of **Flutter UI**, **state management**, and **backend integration**.
